# Simio-Car-Rental
A simulation of a fake car rental company at an airport using Simio.

This company needed to figure out how many employees to hire and what times to schedule them. It also needed to know how many van drivers to hire and what size vans to purchase. Departing customers would drop their cars off before going on vacation, while arriving customers would rent those cars. A simulation was designed to find the optimal numbers to the above while still having the company make a profit.
